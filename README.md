Beeps that tell you the price percentage difference and direction since last run

Each beep represents a percentage difference since the last run. The bell plays instead of the last beep if the price is lower.

2 beeps = 2% price increase
2 beeps and a bell = 3% price drop


Run it with cron so the execution intervals are regular.
